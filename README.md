# Implementing-Multi-layer-Perceptron
🧠 Project Description

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network, one of the most fundamental and widely used architectures in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
An MLP is a feedforward neural network consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, where each neuron uses an activation function to learn complex, non-linear relationships within data.

The project demonstrates how the MLP learns by performing forward propagation and backpropagation using gradient descent, adjusting the connection weights to minimize prediction error.

Through this implementation, users can understand:

How multiple layers and neurons work together to approximate complex functions

The process of training a neural network using error minimization

How activation functions and learning rates affect model performance

This experiment bridges the gap between simple perceptrons and advanced deep learning models, forming the conceptual foundation of architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
